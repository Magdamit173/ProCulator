# Update

## Description
- ProCulator Was Designed And Inspired by Programming And Calculating
- While Calculator Has Limited Syntax, Well Programming Can Do A Lot!!!
- So Much Stuff Can Do, Trig Functions, Create your own Function, Name Your Own Variable For Specified Session, Intervals, And Many More!!!
- Enjoy!!! :)

## Disadvantage

- Can't Store Variable and Function If App/Site Has Been Terminated
- There's no autocorrection/spellchecker so it's like c++ in notepad xd 
* (i hope you get the joke, the joke is "c++ in notepad", did you get it?, you didn't?, aw nah, moving on)
- only **javascript** is supported since i didn't knew what i have done.

## Warning !!! 
- ProCulator use "eval()" just to execute javascript code,"Be Cautious" :)
- Also Spaghetti code (TnT)
